# Kaggle-Santander-Customer-Transaction-Prediction


Building the first end to end pipeline of a ML project experiment investigating several Classification Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGboost, KNN, SVM), related to the Stantander Kaggle Competition (link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction). This has been explored in PART 1.
A first approach of an automated grid search to find the best structure of a Neural Network has been invastigated in PART 2.
